# Privacy Policy Setup - Step by Step

## Quick Answer: No Domain Needed!

You can host your privacy policy for FREE using GitHub Gist. Takes 2 minutes!

## 🚀 Easiest Method: GitHub Gist (Recommended)

### Step 1: Customize Your Privacy Policy

1. Open `privacy-policy.html` (I created this for you!)
2. Find these placeholders and replace them:
   - `[Date - Replace with actual date...]` → Change to today's date like "January 15, 2025"
   - `[your-email@example.com - REPLACE THIS!]` → Your real email address
   - `[your-support-url.com - REPLACE THIS...]` → Your support URL (or delete this line if you don't have one)

3. Save the file

### Step 2: Create GitHub Gist

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
2. If you don't have GitHub account:
   - Click "Sign up" (free, takes 30 seconds)
   - Use any email
3. If you already have GitHub:
   - Just login

### Step 3: Upload Your Privacy Policy

1. Click the big "+" button or "New gist" button
2. In "Filename including extension", type: `privacy-policy.html`
3. Open your `privacy-policy.html` file (the one you customized)
4. Copy ALL the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
5. Paste it into the big text box on Gist
6. Make sure "Create public gist" is selected (this is important!)
7. Click "Create public gist" button

### Step 4: Get Your URL

1. After creating, you'll see your privacy policy displayed
2. Copy the URL from your browser address bar
   - It will look like: `https://gist.github.com/yourusername/abc123def456...`
3. **Save this URL!** You'll need it for App Store Connect

### Step 5: Test It

1. Open the URL in a new browser tab (or incognito window)
2. Make sure it shows your privacy policy nicely formatted
3. If it looks good, you're done! ✅

## 📋 Alternative: Use Markdown Version

If you prefer, you can also use the markdown version:

1. Open `PRIVACY_POLICY_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Customize all the `[brackets]` placeholders
3. Go to gist.github.com
4. Create new gist with filename: `privacy-policy.md`
5. Paste your customized content
6. Create public gist
7. Copy the URL

**Note**: The HTML version looks nicer when viewed, but markdown works too!

## ✅ What Apple Needs

Apple just needs:
- ✅ A URL that's publicly accessible
- ✅ Shows your privacy policy
- ✅ Doesn't require login to view

**GitHub Gist URLs work perfectly!** Many apps use them.
