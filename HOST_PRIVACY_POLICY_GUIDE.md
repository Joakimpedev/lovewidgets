## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use GitHub Gist (Option 1)** - It's the fastest and easiest!

1. Takes 2 minutes
2. No signup needed (if you have GitHub) or free signup
3. Looks professional
4. Apple accepts it (many apps use Gist URLs)

## 📝 What Apple Needs

Apple just needs:
- ✅ A publicly accessible URL
- ✅ That shows your privacy policy
- ✅ That's always available

**Any of these options work!** They don't care if it's `gist.github.com` or `yourdomain.com` - as long as it's accessible.

## 🚀 Quick Setup: GitHub Gist (Recommended)

Want me to help you set this up? I can:

1. Create an HTML version of your privacy policy (better formatting)
2. Guide you through the Gist setup
3. Help you customize the template first

Just say "yes" and I'll create a ready-to-paste HTML version for you!

## 💡 Alternative: Even Simpler

If you want something even simpler, you could also:
- Use a Google Doc (make it publicly viewable) - though Gist looks more professional
- Use Notion page (set to public) - also works

**But GitHub Gist is really the best balance of easy + professional!**

---

**TL;DR**: Use GitHub Gist - go to gist.github.com, paste your privacy policy, get instant URL. No domain needed! 🎉
